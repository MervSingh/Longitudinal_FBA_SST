# NICAP_FBA

Contains code for conducting tract of interest Fixel-based Analysis (FBA) in MRTrix3Tissue (https://3tissue.github.io/)

This analysis forms part of a larger project involving  ADHD and non-ADHD data from the Neuroimaging of the Children's Attention Project (NICAP; https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-016-0770-4).

Users attemtping to run the scripts contained in this repository should note that the code is optimised for use on the Monash M3 High Performance Computing Cluster (https://docs.massive.org.au/), but can be adapted to work on a local system. Of note, we relied heavily on the MRTrix3Tissue (https://3tissue.github.io/) and TractSeg (https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/TractSeg), FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/) and FreeSurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) Software packages and their dependencies

All software required to run the analyses are contained in the "Modules" file. These are loaded directly into the M3 HPC terminal environment. Those attemtping to run the analyses locally must install the software separately on their system.
